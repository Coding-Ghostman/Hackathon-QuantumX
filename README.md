# Hackathon-QuantumX
This is a project based on the problem statement:
  Build an AI-Enabled Recruitment App.
-------------------------------------
Show a form to Candidate to upload the Resume. 
Parse all important fields from the CV and store into a Database Table called Candidate_Master (Name, Address, email, phone number, Skills, Date of Birth, Location, Current Company, years of experience, etc.). Use a CV parsing library for this.   
Create another Form to search the best candidates on a given Skill set and experience range. 
- If there are 200 resumes and you are searching for Java Profiles of experience between 2 to 4 years, it should come up with the most relevant Profiles in rank-ordered basis. 
- Teksands can provide data (resumes) for Testing. 
- Use a combination of NLP and Rule-based mechanisms to achieve this.
